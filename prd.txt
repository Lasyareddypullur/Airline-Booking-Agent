# Airline Booking Support AI – Project Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Project Overview

The Airline Booking Support AI is a voice-based conversational assistant designed to handle customer service calls for airline bookings and add-on services. The system will enable customers to perform multiple actions in a single call, such as seat selection, baggage addition, priority services, special assistance requests, receiving booking summaries via WhatsApp, and transferring to a human specialist when required (e.g., pet travel).

The AI assistant will provide a natural, human-like conversation flow while performing real-time checks, cost calculations, booking updates, and secure handoff to live agents.
