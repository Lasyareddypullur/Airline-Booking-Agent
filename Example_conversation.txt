AI Assistant: Hello, thank you for calling *** Airlines Customer Service. This is Isha speaking. How may I assist you today?

Person: Hi Isha, this is Rahul here. My PNR is ***. I’d like to select my seat, add extra baggage, get priority check-in, arrange a wheelchair for my mother, and also travel with my dog. Can you help me with all that?

AI Assistant: Absolutely, Rahul. Let me help you step by step. First, just to confirm, your PNR is ***, and your flight is from Bangalore to Delhi?

Person: Yes, that’s right.

AI Assistant: Great. For seat selection, would you prefer a window, aisle, or extra legroom seat?

Person: I’d like a window seat, please.

AI Assistant: Okay, checking availability. I see a standard window seat available for Rs. 200. Would you like me to book that?

Person: Yes, please go ahead.

AI Assistant: Done. Your window seat is confirmed. Next, extra baggage—how many extra kilograms do you need?

Person: I need 10 kgs extra.

AI Assistant: Alright. For domestic flights, it’s Rs. 500 per 5 kg, so Rs. 1000 for 10 kg. Shall I add that?

Person: Yes, that’s fine.

AI Assistant: Added. Now, priority check-in and boarding—we include that free of charge with our priority service add-on. Shall I activate it for you?

Person: Yes, please do that.

AI Assistant: All set. Now, wheelchair assistance for your mother. May I have her name and her gate-to-gate requirement?

Person: Her name is Mrs. Sushma Verma, and she needs assistance from check-in all the way through landing and check-out at the destination.

AI Assistant: Got it, Rahul. Wheelchair assistance for Mrs. Sushma Verma from check-in all the way to her seat at the gate is arranged. There is no extra cost for this service.

Now, about your dog—could you please tell me your dog’s breed and weight?

Person: She’s a Labrador, about 25 kgs.

AI Assistant: Got it. For pets on board, I’ll need to connect you to our specialist team who will complete the booking and documentation for your Labrador weighing 25 kg.

Before I transfer you, can I send you a summary of everything we’ve booked so far via WhatsApp?

Person: Yeah, please send it.

AI Assistant: Perfect. I’m sending you a WhatsApp message with your seat details, baggage charges, priority service, and wheelchair confirmation. Please make the payment and everything will be set.

Now, I’ll transfer you to our pets-on-board specialist to finalize your dog’s booking. Please hold for a moment.
